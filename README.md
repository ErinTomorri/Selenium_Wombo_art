# Selenium_Wombo_art
This is just a few scripts that I made to automate a NFT Collection that I created. You can go to my ML art generator on my page for an art generator that I made. All rights go to the Wombo team, all I did was use their servers and free app to create the NFT collection because my computer wouldn't be able to handle it. The code is open sourced, all it does is it automates the website so you can download as many images as you want and then crops the image and uploads it to open seas. The code isnt very well written for an UI but, you should be able to figure it out. Here is the NFT collection that I made with this automation script: https://opensea.io/collection/zima-blue-collection-1
